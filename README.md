# Substreams ERC20 Balance Changes
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

The goal of this Substreams project is to extract all ERC20/ERC721 transfers from Ethereum events for the full chain.

The `map_balance_changes` module will output messages of type `erc20.types.v1.BalanceChange` defined by: 

```proto
message BalanceChange {
string contract = 1;
string owner = 2;
string old_balance = 3;
string new_balance = 4;

string transaction = 5;
string storage_key = 6;
string call_index = 7;

string transfer_value = 8;

BalanceChangeType change_type = 9;
}
```

## Known issues:

Tracking balance changes requires tracking state changes on chain.  However, different contracts have different ways of storing balances.  

We have implemented the following strategies for tracking balance changes:

### Type 1: Storage change is in the same call as the transfer

example:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf490320cff087d82747fcb0e6ed797f899ff887bcd15162933ea051c94c596ea#eventlog

        "ordinal": "1155"
      }
    ],
    "logs": [
      {
        "address": "dac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
        "topics": [
          "ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
          "00000000000000000000000045225d3536ac02928f16071ab05066bce95c2cd5",
          "000000000000000000000000caf7ce56598e8588c9bf471e08b53e8a8d9541b3"
        ],
        "data": "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c84cfb23",
        "blockIndex": 49,
        "ordinal": "1157"
      }
    ]
  }
```

The correctness of the `old_balance` and `new_balance` values in this case is easily determined.

These types of transfers will result in a BalanceChange message with `change_type` set to `TYPE_1`.

### Type 2: Storage change is in a different call than the transfer

example:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5a31fb5d3f5bbb95023438f017ad6cd501ce70e445f31c2660c784e5a7eb5d83#eventlog

In this case, the Transfer is done in call index 4, but the storage change is actually recorded in call index 10.  Here is the relevant section from the Firehose block for this transaction:

```json
{
  "index": 4,
  "logs": [
    {
      "address": "225bc3affc1da39bd3cb2100c74a41c62310d1e1",
      "topics": [
        "ddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",

        "000000000000000000000000b30acc73814d34941d71a1dfa5c2a5e618a062fe"
      ],
      "data": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000451f50",
      "index": 2,
      "blockIndex": 2,
      "ordinal": "68"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "index": 10,
  "keccakPreimages": {
    "c0309ad5a3dcaf0d46cab6102b742e914f7ff8447190f509bf80a0f0b60c452c": "000000000000000000000000b30acc73814d34941d71a1dfa5c2a5e618a062fe0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
  },
  "storageChanges": [
    {
      "address": "276c5c6ca8507ed7bac085fc9b9521f4f54b58d3",
      "key": "c0309ad5a3dcaf0d46cab6102b742e914f7ff8447190f509bf80a0f0b60c452c",
      "oldValue": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012d03e73e",
      "newValue": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012d48915e",
      "ordinal": "61"
    }
  ],
}
```

So some logic is required to track the storage change to the transfer.

The correctness of the `old_balance` and `new_balance` values in this case is not as easily determined.  It is an open question at this point as to whether the values given in the `oldValue` and `newValue` fields always correspond to the correct balance values.

These types of transfers will result in a BalanceChange message with `change_type` set to `TYPE_2`.

### Others

There are other types of transfers where the balance of the accounts before and after is not clear.

example:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5a31fb5d3f5bbb95023438f017ad6cd501ce70e445f31c2660c784e5a7eb5d83#eventlog

These transfers will result in a BalanceChange message with `change_type` set to `null`.

These should currently be discarded by the consumer of the substream as they are guaranteed to be incorrect.
